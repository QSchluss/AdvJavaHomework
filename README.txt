SortingHomework.java is a program for my advanced java programming course where the assignment was to generate 4 arrays of increasing size populated with random numbers, then time how long it takes
for two different sorting algorithms to sort them.  The expected outputs of the program is four pairs of sorting times, usually with comb sort taking significantly less ticks to complete than bubble sort.
